# Rewind

## NOTE: Rewind is *NOT* open source.

### What is rewind?
Rewind is a 3d, portal style puzzle game. It involved rewinding objects in time to solve puzzles that couldn't otherwise be solved.

### What is this repository?
A select few scripts will be released for aspiring developers to make their own portal style puzzle games. Any script here is for you to do with as you want. No credit is required, all though it is appriciated if you credit nab138.

### There are barely any scripts here!
I know! As the game evolves and I optimize I will start to release finilized scripts. Be patient!
